## Ops201-class2

This repo was designed and worked on in the Code Fellows Ops 201d6 class.

The items in this repo are various scripts based off of Bash and PowerShell. The various scripts are a combination of arrays, variables, functions, and some loops to achieve different results with information systems.
Learning to read and write script has long term benefits of not only setting up and managing networks, but also being able to understand malicious files. 
If I am able to open an executable file in Windows, I can see what all the file is affecting. I can also learn where else on the device needs tending to correct issues and remove malicious content to fix errors and increase stability and security.
I wish to learn more about all the commands and how I can make more detailed functions or boolean commands.
If I had more time, I would be trying to come up with fun games and more interaction with bash and Powershell scripts. I want to get a firm grasp on all they provide, and see how I can use it for pen testing.
